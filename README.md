# IMAGE-PROCESSING
This is my first machine learning project, IMAGE PROCESSING
When it comes to image data, ML algorithms can interpret images the same way our brains do. These are used almost everywhere, right from face recognition while capturing images on our smartphones, automating tedious manual work, self-driving cars and everything in between.

It is divided into three part;
1) Reading an image file and converting it to a numpy array.
2) Resizing an image
3) RGB to Grayscale conversion

In the first part we only print the original image without any change.
In the second part we resize the image i,e,. we can make image large and small.
In the last part we are changing the colorfull image into black and white.
